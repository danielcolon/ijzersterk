                    <p>Ego lifting is one of the most commonly made mistakes in beginning and intermediate strength sport athletes, almost all lifters will let their ego interfere with their training at some point. What exactly is ego lifting? Is it really so bad? And how can I avoid it?</p>

                    <h4>The ugly</h4>
                    <p>
                        <div className="row">

                            <div className="col-md-8 col-xs-12">Ego lifting is going too heavy or wanting too much out of every training, which leads to bad form, injuries and stagnation in training. You are lifting more than you should, to satisfy your ego. For example: you are following a training program where you are required to deadlift 3 sets of 3 repetitions at 80% of your one-rep max. Instead of doing this 80% you do 90% or 100%, you push yourself to the limit, without considering your program or the basic principles of any strength sport, such as progressive overload.<br/>
                            Or you felt good that day, or you want to impress that hot chick or boy that came and cranked out two more quarter repetitions, that is ego lifting.<br/>
                            But ego lifting can also be that you stay oblivious over the fact that your form is bad. Or you do not need to eat that, or research that. In a sense it is lifting without thinking, it is a workout.

                                        A good example of ego lifting. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWsVnE2854I">This women tried to deadlift in heels, which ended ugly.</a>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </p>

                    <h4>The good</h4>
                    <p>But, there can be times that it is a good thing. An anecdote example is that I decided to screw my training on that day and go nuts on the deadlift and max out. I broke my plateau and gained a lot of confidence in my deadlift that resulted in hitting 210 kg for two repetitions two week after that. Which I probably would not have been able to if I did not go crazy that day.</p>

                    <h4>The bad</h4>
                    <p>So going crazy and not respecting form or the training cycle can benefit your confidence or you can even learn a new thing, but that is a workout not a training. It is a rare exception that it went well, I could have injured myself.
                        Reason I call it a workout is because I was not improving my form nor my volume nor my anything except maybe my ego. Each session you spend in the gym, is a training session. Training to reach that goal you have set, that six plate deadlift, that two plate bench, that body you have always dreamed. You achieve that by perfecting form and by doing progressieve overload. You are not improving your form when you are maxing out each session, you are not improving when you injury yourself, you are not improving efficiently when you are lifting with bad form.</p>

                    <p>My concluding words are: <br/>
                    <i>&#8220;Keep your ego in check and lift with your head&#8222;</i>

                    <p>Dear krachtpatser/powerhouse,</p>
                    <p>It has been a while since our last update, but we want you to know we're still active and lifting heavy weights! The 'Sterkste Student van Delft' was a great success, with 20 contestants! We are excited to organize it again next year.</p>

                    <h4>Start of our Club</h4>
                    <p>We've decided to start our club off slow by training in the VKR (the strength room outside the Sports Centre, near the gate) once a week on Saturday with our members, to get to know each other and discuss what we want to see happen in the club. In the upcoming year we hope to gain a lot of new, enthusiastic members. Eventually our goal is to have monthly seminars, and multiple strength sport events per year. Talk to us in the gym or reply to this email if you're interested in becoming a member of our lovely club, or have some great ideas!</p>

                    <h4>Website</h4>
                    <p>We are currently in the process of updating our website: ijzersterkdelft.nl. In the future the website will host blogs and an agenda application which shows who's available for instruction in the gym or when your buddies are training.</p>

                    <h4>Wiki</h4>
                    <p>The website is already hosting a wiki about Strength Sports and all it's aspects, we want to expand this to a big knowledge base, supervised by our club. The goal of the wiki is to have easy access to useful knowledge in an easy, straight forward format for beginners, intermediates and advanced lifters. Check out our wiki at: wiki.ijzersterkdelft.nl.</p>

                    <p>IJzersterk organises the powerlifting competition: 'De sterkste Student(e) van delft' (translated: The Strongest Student in Delft), which will take place on March 22 from 09:30 till 17:30 in hall 3 in the sport centre of the TU Delft.</p>
                    <p>The competition is open for anyone, but be quick because there are limited slots available.</p>
                    <p>It will be exciting and awesome day where you can show your strength and proof that you are the strongest student in Delft. The competition exists of three parts: the squat, the bench press and the deadlift in that order. Your score will be calculated by taking the total of the three lifts and multiplied by the wilks coefficient, which is based on your gender and body weight.</p>
                    <p>For each of the three lifts we will give a short demonstration on how to perform the lift correctly, safely and in the most efficient way.</p>
                    <p>You can register for the event <a href="http://sc.tudelft.nl/nl/agenda/event/detail/223-delfts-strongest-student-mf/">here</a>, there is also a 5 euro fee to cover the costs of the materials.
