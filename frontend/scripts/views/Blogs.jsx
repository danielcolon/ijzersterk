                    <p><b>I have been lifting since I was 16 years old for general fitness, bodybuilding, injury recovery and for the past two years powerlifting. Yet I had never participated in any competition or meet up until last Sunday. I was lacking motivation and first-hand competition experience which all of other members of the board did have. So I decided to give it a shot… </b></p><br/>

                    <h4>How did I prepare for the big day? </h4>
                    <p>In terms of training I barely prepared. The reason is that I did not have many choices in competitions to participate in. The SBD Cup was de last bond-organized meet this year in which you could qualify yourself for the Dutch nationals in December. So it came down to a month of time to prepare, but I would also be on holiday for two weeks. I tried to determine my opening weights before I left and during my holiday I managed to slip in one workout. After I came back I had a full week left in which I had four workouts focusing mainly on form and I cut some water to keep my weight in check. Then I had two days of rest and I was just hoping for the best.</p>
                    <h4>Lightweight!</h4>
                    <p>I was in the first session of the day with the weigh-in starting at 7:30. It surprised me when I ended up weighing only 80.8kg (-83kg class). I applied water cut in the week leading up to the competition and part of that is no drinking or eating starting 12 hours before the weigh-in. After the weigh-in you got approximately two hours to rehydrate and eat, during this time you should focus on carbs, minerals and water. With Pouja as my coach we had tons of food and drinks with us so then the waiting game began.</p>
                    <h4>Warming up and opening with squats</h4>
                    <p>30 Minutes before the first lift we started warming up and to our horror we found out that we had to warm up outside in the cold! So, always bring warm clothes and remember that circumstances will often be far from ideal. I changed my opener on the squat last minute with 5kg to 175kg as I was feeling quite good. My feeling was right as I squatted 3/3 with respectively 175kg, 185kg, 195kg(+5 PR!). It boosted my confidence and I was ready for the next lift.</p>
                    <h4>Signals and ego lifting</h4>
                    <p>Bench press has always been one of my weakest lifts and I was not too confident in my form. My opener of 110kg was no lift because I did not wait for the referee’s signal. The weight itself was not a problem so I did 115kg on my second attempt which went fine. From then on it went downhill. I increased my planned third attempt by 2.5kg to 122.5kg but I lost focus and form during the attempt and failed. I am not sure if it was a case of ego lifting, fatigue or just bad focus. If you want to learn more about ego lifting you should check out the previous blog post. There was no time to waste and I had to put my thoughts on the last and my best lift, the deadlift. </p>
                    <h4>Playing safe or taking risks</h4>
                    <p>First off, I love deadlifting. I knew I could get back into the competition with deadlifts. I opened 220kg with good form and speed. 235kg for the second attempt with good form and slightly less speed. For the final lift it was a toss-up between 245kg (gym PR) or 250kg (tried once in gym and failed lift-off). I took the risk and went with the 250kg and failed on grip, which really surprised me. Looking back I am not sure if 245kg would have made a big difference. One of the things I am still struggling with is consistency in the pre-lift rituals. It took me a lot longer to actually start the lift with the third attempt compared to the other attempts. As a result I lost confidence. I tend to have this problem when I am lifting weights I am not comfortable with and often. Ideally, you want to have the same pre-lift ritual with every rep of every set, even your warm-up sets! </p>
                    <h4>Qualified and now what?</h4>
                    <p>My total of 545kg at 80.8kg bodyweight placed me second of 11 participants in the men’s open classic -83kg. All lifters with Wilks above 340 points were qualified for the nationals and so was I (369.8 Wilks). In the end I have no regrets getting into the world of powerlifting competitions. It was inspirational, I got to know lots of people with the same interest and it’s a great way to stay motivated and (officially) log your progress. </p>
                    <p>Now I have three months to properly prepare for the nationals and I am going to follow a Sheiko program (#37v2, #31, #32v2). This is a Russian powerlifting program with the unique emphasis on volume rather than high weights. It seems like a fitting approach for me as I have to work on my form (esp. bench) and the way of training appeals to me. If you are interested in following the program yourself you can check out his website <a href="http://sheiko-program.ru/">http://sheiko-program.ru/</a>. Just interested in my progress?

                    <p>It was a hot summer afternoon with big rainfall and thunder, but there was one thing that overcame the shivering that Mother Nature directed to us, and that was the first IJZERSTERK clinic.. A good amount of enthusiastic and curious new students came to see what we are all about. After the opening speech by our president, Peter Evers, we started off with instructions on the big three lifts. The board helped everybody out with the techniques of the squat, bench and deadlift and gave some demo’s. The atmosphere was very relaxing yet uplifting and even some PR’s were broken, this shows the potential of lifting together with IJzersterk. We all had a splendid time with all of the participants and hopefully we will see you guys in the gym and joining our iron strong squad!</p>

                    <h1>Ego lifting</h1>
                    <div className="date">August 26, 2015 | <span className="name">Pouja</span> | 3 min read</div>
                    <p>Ego lifting is one of the most commonly made mistakes in beginning and intermediate strength sport athletes, almost all lifters will let their ego interfere with their training at some point. What exactly is ego lifting? Is it really so bad? And how can I avoid it?</p>
                    <h4>The ugly</h4>
                    <p>
                        <div className="row">
                            <div className="col-md-8 col-xs-12">Ego lifting is going too heavy or wanting too much out of every training, which leads to bad form, injuries and stagnation in training. You are lifting more than you should, to satisfy your ego. For example: you are following a training program where you are required to deadlift 3 sets of 3 repetitions at 80% of your one-rep max. Instead of doing this 80% you do 90% or 100%, you push yourself to the limit, without considering your program or the basic principles of any strength sport, such as progressive overload.<br/>
                            Ego lifting can also lead to less reflection on your lift, you keep using bad form. In a sense it is lifting without thinking, it is a workout.
                            </div>
                            <div className="col-md-4 col-xs-12">
                                <div className="thumbnail">
                                    <img src="http://body-builderz.com/wp-content/uploads/deadlift-in-high-heels.png?1469b1"/>
                                    <div className="caption">
                                        A good example of ego lifting. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWsVnE2854I">This woman tried to deadlift in heels, which ended ugly.</a>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </p>

                    <h4>The good</h4>
                    <p>But, there can be times that ego lifting is a good thing. An anecdote example is that I decided to screw my training on that day and go nuts on the deadlift and max out. I broke my plateau and gained a lot of confidence in my deadlift that resulted in hitting 210 kg for two repetitions two week after that. Which I probably would not have been able to if I did not go crazy that day.</p>

                    <h4>The bad</h4>
                    <p>So going crazy and not respecting form or the training cycle can benefit your confidence or you can even learn a new thing, but that is a workout not a training. It is a rare exception that it went well, I could have injured myself.
                        Reason I called it a workout is because I was not improving my form nor my volume nor my anything except for maybe my ego. Each session you spend in the gym, is a training session. Training to reach that goal you have set, that six plate deadlift, that two plate bench, that body you have always dreamed of. You achieve that by perfecting form and by doing progressieve overload. You are not improving your form when you are maxing out every each session, you are not improving when you injury yourself, you are not improving efficiently when you are lifting with bad form.</p>
                    <p>My concluding words are: <br/>
                    <i>&#8220;Keep your ego in check and lift with your head&#8222;</i>

                    <p>Dear krachtpatser/powerhouse,</p>
                    <p>It has been a while since our last update, but we want you to know we're still active and lifting heavy weights! The 'Sterkste Student van Delft' was a great success, with 20 contestants! We are excited to organize it again next year.</p>

                    <h4>Start of our Club</h4>
                    <p>We've decided to start our club off slow by training in the VKR (the strength room outside the Sports Centre, near the gate) once a week on Saturday with our members, to get to know each other and discuss what we want to see happen in the club. In the upcoming year we hope to gain a lot of new, enthusiastic members. Eventually our goal is to have monthly seminars, and multiple strength sport events per year. Talk to us in the gym or reply to this email if you're interested in becoming a member of our lovely club, or have some great ideas!</p>

                    <h4>Website</h4>
                    <p>We are currently in the process of updating our website: ijzersterkdelft.nl. In the future the website will host blogs and an agenda application which shows who's available for instruction in the gym or when your buddies are training.</p>

                    <h4>Wiki</h4>
                    <p>The website is already hosting a wiki about Strength Sports and all it's aspects, we want to expand this to a big knowledge base, supervised by our club. The goal of the wiki is to have easy access to useful knowledge in an easy, straight forward format for beginners, intermediates and advanced lifters. Check out our wiki at: wiki.ijzersterkdelft.nl.</p>

                    <p>IJzersterk organises the powerlifting competition: 'De sterkste Student(e) van delft' (translated: The Strongest Student in Delft), which will take place on March 22 from 09:30 till 17:30 in hall 3 in the sport centre of the TU Delft.</p>
                    <p>The competition is open for anyone, but be quick because there are limited slots available.</p>
                    <p>It will be exciting and awesome day where you can show your strength and proof that you are the strongest student in Delft. The competition exists of three parts: the squat, the bench press and the deadlift in that order. Your score will be calculated by taking the total of the three lifts and multiplied by the wilks coefficient, which is based on your gender and body weight.</p>
                    <p>For each of the three lifts we will give a short demonstration on how to perform the lift correctly, safely and in the most efficient way.</p>
                    <p>You can register for the event <a href="http://sc.tudelft.nl/nl/agenda/event/detail/223-delfts-strongest-student-mf/">here</a>, there is also a 5 euro fee to cover the costs of the materials.
