            <h1>New website is live!</h1>
            <p>Our new website with the new logo is live. We worked hard together with <a href="http://www.zokodesign.com">Zoko</a> to set up the new lay out of the website. Zoko also made the new logos:</p>

            </div>
            <p>All the news, blogs and latest changes will be posted on the website from now on. So make sure to follow the website. We will still send the newsletters, which will also be posted on the news page.</p>
            <p>A new feature we are working on is the agenda system. In this system it will be possible for members to log in and see who is going to train when. It will also be possible to indicate that you want to train with someone.</p>

            <h1>News letter #2</h1>
            <p>Dear krachtpatser/powerhouse,</p>
            <p>It has been a while since our last update, but we want you to know we're still active and lifting heavy weights! The 'Sterkste Student van Delft' was a great success, with 20 contestants! We are excited to organize it again next year.</p>

            <h4>Start of our Club</h4>
            <p>We've decided to start our club off slow by training in the VKR (the strength room outside the Sports Centre, near the gate) once a week on Saturday with our members, to get to know each other and discuss what we want to see happen in the club. In the upcoming year we hope to gain a lot of new, enthusiastic members. Eventually our goal is to have monthly seminars, and multiple strength sport events per year. Talk to us in the gym or reply to this email if you're interested in becoming a member of our lovely club, or have some great ideas!</p>

            <h4>Website</h4>
            <p>We are currently in the process of updating our website: ijzersterkdelft.nl. In the future the website will host blogs and an agenda application which shows who's available for instruction in the gym or when your buddies are training.</p>

            <h4>Wiki</h4>
            <p>The website is already hosting a wiki about Strength Sports and all it's aspects, we want to expand this to a big knowledge base, supervised by our club. The goal of the wiki is to have easy access to useful knowledge in an easy, straight forward format for beginners, intermediates and advanced lifters. Check out our wiki at: wiki.ijzersterkdelft.nl.</p>

            <h1>Sterkste Student(e) van Delft</h1>
            <p>IJzersterk organises the powerlifting competition: 'De sterkste Student(e) van delft' (translated: The Strongest Student in Delft), which will take place on March 22 from 09:30 till 17:30 in hall 3 in the sport centre of the TU Delft.<p>
            <p>The competition is open for anyone, but be quick because there are limited slots available.</p>
            <p>It will be exciting and awesome day where you can show your strength and proof that you are the strongest student in Delft. The competition exists of three parts: the squat, the bench press and the deadlift in that order. Your score will be calculated by taking the total of the three lifts and multiplied by the wilks coefficient, which is based on your gender and body weight.</p>
            <p>For each of the three lifts we will give a short demonstration on how to perform the lift correctly, safely and in the most efficient way.</p>
